Dear college recruiting and hiring colleagues,  

I want to bring to your attention a very important study, that our office (UNC Chapel Hill University Career Services) is conducting in partnership with over 200 other colleges and universities.  The college hiring project provides valuable information to our students transitioning into the labor market. You may have participated in past surveys and I encourage you to participate again this year.  If you have not participated, I strongly encourage you to complete the survey.

Through your efforts we will be able to provide graduating students, as well as recent graduates, their advisors, and talent managers, such as yourself, valuable and timely information.  Once we have our state and regional data we will be able to share that with you in early 2014.

Labor market conditions remain challenging, making students graduating anxious about their future. The survey takes 20 to 35 minutes to complete.  

Even if you will not be hiring college graduates during the 2013 – 2014 academic year, the information you provide will help us develop an accurate picture of this year’s employment prospects for college students.

You may receive multiple invitations to participate in this study given the number of schools working on the project.  You only have to complete the survey once. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. 

Our survey constructs a profile of the hiring situation by economic sector, geographic location and company size.  You have the right to refuse to answer any question.  Your information will be treated with strict confidence. No individual or company will be identified.  Only group data will be used in our reports and your confidentiality will be protected to the maximum extent allowed by law.  

You have several options in responding to the survey.  
• Complete the online survey at the following url: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Trends20132014
• Download a paper version or electronic survey at the CERI website, www.ceri.msu.edu.
• Send the paper to: 
          Dr. Phil Gardner, Director
          Collegiate Employment Research Institute
          113 SSB
          Michigan State University
          East Lansing, MI 48824
• Fax your survey to (517) 355-9523.

Because of security protocols on some computer system, you may not be able to access the survey through Survey Monkey.  Please either download the survey or ask Dr. Gardner at gardnerp@msu.edu to send you a survey form.

We would like to receive your information by September 30th.  For your participation in the study you will be sent the report, Recruiting Trends 2013-2014, shortly after it is released on November 22nd.  Additional information will be sent to you as reports as produced.

If you have any concerns or questions about this research study, scientific issues, how to do any part of it, or if you believe you have been harmed because of the research, please contact Phil Gardner at 517-355-2211 or gardnerp@msu.edu. Dr. Gardner serves as advisor to this project.

On behalf of all graduating students, I thank you for your time and extend best wishes in all your endeavors.

All the best, 

O. Ray Angle, Director
University Career Services
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
