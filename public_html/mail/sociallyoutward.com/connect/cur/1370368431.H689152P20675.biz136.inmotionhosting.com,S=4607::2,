Hi all,

I apologize if you are getting this email twice. We are trying to make sure
we have everyone on the 1789 GoogleGroup list serve. If you have not
accepted the invitation, please do so ASAP. If you need an invitation,
please let us know. It will be much easier to communicate with all of the
1789 community if everyone is on the list serve. Thanks so much!

Also, there is a cool festival called Paradoxos going on in Durham this
Thursday and Friday. There is an event called Pitch Day, Thursday from
10:00 am - 12:00 pm and The Next on Friday from 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm. We think
it would be great for ventures to attend either of these events! You must
register/buy tickets by this evening.

More details and tickets here: http://paradoxos.co


Best,
Mary Elizabeth, Aaron, Taylor, and Kailey
