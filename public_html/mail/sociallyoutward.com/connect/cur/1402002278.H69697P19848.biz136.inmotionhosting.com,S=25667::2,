<br>
My name is Kyle Laverty and I am interested in the Web and Mobile Developer=
 opportunity with Socially Outward Inc. I have attached my resume for your =
review, and will give you a rundown of my skills and things I have worked o=
n.<br>










<br>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery) are my main areas of expertise. =
I can also throw down some PHP code and basic Ruby on Rails. I am experienc=
ed using Bootstrap, Foundation, and building WordPress themes. I also have =
some AngularJS experience and have been looking for ways to use it with my =
current company&#39;s system, as well as just doing something cool with it =
on my own time. I recently began digging into Node.js and Grunt as well, an=
d have a basic understanding of both.<br>










<br>Here are some things I have worked on recently:<br><br><a href=3D"http:=
