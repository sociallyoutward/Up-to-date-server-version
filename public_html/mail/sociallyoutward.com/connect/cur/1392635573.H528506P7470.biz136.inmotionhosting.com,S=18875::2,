Hi Matt, I apologize for the late notice but we are going to meet up at 178=
9 today around noon, probably until about 1. It is right next to Four Squar=
es on Franklin street. My cell number is 814-671-4704 in case nobody is out=
 front, the door is typically locked.
If you can't make it today, we can figure out another time for you to meet =
everyone, but can still send you an update on the plans for the cooking wee=
k.

Hi Matt, Thanks for the response. I work with Ken on the business operation=
s side.

We are currently seeking an intern that has expertise with programming to h=
it the ground running.

That being said, we could utilize someone that has the ability to assist ou=
r chief programmer in researching topics and providing information on the n=
ext steps needed in building the site and mobile application platform.

This could provide the exposure you  want to a variety of coding topics and=
 languages, and a place to begin learning the entire process. If this sound=
s like something you might be interested in pursuing, let me know and we ca=
n continue the discussion and set up a time for you to meet the team.

Regards,
Joe
