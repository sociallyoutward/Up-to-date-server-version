Hello Joseph,

Thank you for your interest in this opportunity. Socially Outward sounds
like a great organization for students to create a marketing strategy plan.

We will launch the project on September 18 in Dr. Didow's two sections of
introductory marketing. Would you be able to attend the classes for a short
presentation from 2:45-3:15 and 3:30-4:00pm? We are asking each
participating organization to prepare one slide with basic information
(mission statement, core activities, marketing thoughts, and how you got
your idea) and pitch to the class for 3 minutes. Students will then ask
follow up questions about and select an organization to work with. We
anticipate each organization will get 2-4 student groups to work with. The
time commitment will be attending this first class, meeting with the
students halfway through the semester, and at the end of the semester to
receive their findings. Should you and the students want to meet on a more
regular basis to go deeper into the work, that is fine with us, but not
required. We want to foster a learning environment that enables students to
learn as much as possible with a real organization, but understand you may
have time constraints.

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have or discuss this
opportunity further.

Many thanks,

Ashley

Hello Ashley,

  I am part of  the venture Socially Outward located in the 1789 venture
lab, and  I received your e-mail about participating with a class project.

 We are a recent start-up, and our technology is currently still under
development. We are anticipating a limited beta launch in the next 6 to 8
months. I've included a brief description below about our company, and we
have no current marketing strategy given our recent formation.

 Our current team is small and we view this partnership with a student team
as a great opportunity. Ken Addison (founder) and myself both work full
time, and Arie Wolf, our chief technologist, is a current senior at UNC. We
are generally available by e-mail or phone during the day, and typically
spend several hours at the venture lab both in the evenings and weekend,
and would work to be available for students as needed.

 Regards,

  Joseph Thomas
