Hi Joe,


Sorry it took me a few days to get back to you, it's been a very busy week =
with finals starting. If you wanted to meet again before the end of the sem=
ester, I will probably be in town until Wednesday.


Also, more information you've developed about the market research would be =
wonderful!


Thank you!


Caley

Hi Caley,

I hope you had a good holiday. Ken and I are figuring out a the that we can=
 meet again, but if you would like I can detail out some of the information=
 we've come up with already for collecting market research.
Going forward, we are open to suggestions that you can make based on your p=
revious experience. Thanks, talk with you later.

Thank you, your resume looks great.

I'll check with Ken to see his availability. This weekend might be difficul=

Hi Caley,

Thanks for the e-mail. My name is Joe Thomas and I work with Ken Addison on=
 the management of Socially Outward.

We are definitely interested in bringing someone as an intern to help us ex=
ecute some of our initial PR/marketing strategy. Would you be able to forwa=
rd your resume so we can have an idea of your experiences? Both Ken and mys=
elf work full time and typically meet up over the weekend (usually at the 1=
789 Venture Lab on Franklin Street).

Let me know your availability and we can plan a time to get together and me=
et.

Thanks again,

 Joe
