Hi Joseph,

My apologies for the delay in my response, I have been in Winston-Salem for
my brother's graduation from Wake Forest.  We are thrilled that you are
excited about 1789.  I would love to give you a tour sometime this week;
what does your availability look like Wednesday and Thursday?

Best,

Taylor
