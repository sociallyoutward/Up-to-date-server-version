Hi Caley,

Thanks for the e-mail. My name is Joe Thomas and I work with Ken Addison on=
 the management of Socially Outward.

We are definitely interested in bringing someone as an intern to help us ex=
ecute some of our initial PR/marketing strategy. Would you be able to forwa=
rd your resume so we can have an idea of your experiences? Both Ken and mys=
elf work full time and typically meet up over the weekend (usually at the 1=
789 Venture Lab on Franklin Street).

Let me know your availability and we can plan a time to get together and me=
et.

Thanks again,

 Joe
