Hello,

Ken and I wanted to send you what we've developed so far regarding market r=
esearch. There are going to be a few Google Drive documents that I'll share=
 with you that will be the place to summarize your interviews, document the=
 businesses you've spoken with, and reference the important questions to as=
k.

Voice-of-Customer (VoC) is what you will be conducting, it is sometime refe=
rred to as 'market research' but it is the first important step in understa=
nding your customer. The information that is gathered in this process is wh=
at informs us of what the customer really needs, and ensures that the produ=
ct we are developing can meet those needs.

Documents:

1. VoC Contact List: This is a list of the bars and restaurants in the imme=
diate Chapel Hill area and is the place to begin with gathering market inte=
lligence. Of course, if you know of addition places that are popular feel f=
ree to contact them.

2. Voc Contact Matrix: This document is to keep track of what business has =
been contacted, and who you spoke with. The best person to speak with in ev=
ery situation is considered the 'decision maker', i.e. usually the 'boss'. =
Other people can provide valuable information as well and should be include=
d, but the decision makers are the individuals that we hope will pay us for=
 our services.

3. VoC questions/discussion points: This is the document that outlines a br=
ief introduction and questions/discussion points to guide the conversation =
to cover important topics. A key here is to attempt to have a normal conver=
sation, there are things that will come up that are extremely important tha=
t may not be on this list.

4. Voc Summaries/Feedback  This is the document to dump all the conversatio=
n notes and summaries from. A key is to really listen to what the person is=
 saying, they may not be able to clearly articulate what 'pain' their busin=
ess is facing, but it is something that we can figure out if you capture th=
e essence of the conversation.

Look for an e-mail from me in a few minutes that gives you access to these =
documents on our Google Drive. Ken and I think that a great goal would be t=
o try to get in contact with 5 businesses a week. Obviously with the holida=
y break this could be difficult and we understand that you may not begin in=
 earnest until back on campus. If you can't speak with the businesses in pe=
rson, a phone call is sufficient, but can be a bit more challenging.

I'm always available for questions by e-mail and I'll be working on this ta=
sk as well. I'm trying to identify which market segment we should speak wit=
h next, and if it would be valuable to expand over to 9th street in Durham =
soon.

As we move forward the exciting thing to do will be to interface with Ken a=
nd Arie as they continue to develop the site to ensure that the features we=
 are providing can solve the problems of our future customers.

The piece of the puzzle that you are contributing to will directly impact t=
he success of all our work, and Ken and I really appreciate you willingness=
 to join us and help build a product that will change the community around =
us. Ken (or I) will be in touch soon to get some feedback from you on progr=
ess and to plan a meeting to discuss your initial findings!

Regards,

Joe
COO Socially Outward
